## ChatBot

This is a simple and modern chatbot application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chatbot communicates with users and responds dynamically by fetching responses from an external API.

## Features

- Clean and responsive UI using CSS.
- User and chatbot messages displayed with a clear distinction.
- Asynchronous interaction using the Fetch API.
- Integrates with external APIs to fetch chatbot responses.
- Auto-scrolls to the most recent messages.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout for a modern look.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Logic for message handling, API requests, and user interactions.
- **API**: Used for chatbot responses (e.g., OpenAI API).

## How It Works

1. User types a message into the input field.
2. When the user clicks the "Send" button, the message is displayed in the chat box.
3. A request is sent to the API to retrieve a response based on the user's message.
4. The response from the API is displayed in the chat as the chatbot's reply.
5. The chat box scrolls automatically to the latest message for better user experience.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot.git
